Where in the world is Danger Dan?

This is my 2013 April Fool's joke. If you have absolutely no idea what is going
on here, it's mostly because this is based on an inside-joke my floor has on me.

(Oh, here's a shoutout for the
[Science and Technology Wing](https://github.com/STWing)), a residential program
in [Kings Court English College House](http://kcech.house.upenn.edu) at UPenn.
As of the timestamp of the last commit, I currently live on the floor.)

This is a relatively simple webapp built on Node.js. It uses my public
Foursquare checkins for my "realtime" location data.
